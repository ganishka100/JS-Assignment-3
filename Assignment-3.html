Q1. Write the Code for all Data types.

Ans1. There are 7 primitive datatypes in javascript:-

1. Null : let myNull = null;
2. Number : let myNumber = 42;
3. Symbol : let mySymbol = Symbol("unique");
4. String : let myBoolean = true;
5. Boolean : let myBoolean = true;
6. BigInt
7. Undefined : let myUndefined = undefined;

There are 2 non-primitive datatypes in javascript:-

1. Object : let myObject = { key: "value", anotherKey: 123 };
2. Array : let myArray = [1, 2, 3, "four", true];

Q2. What are the uses of JavaScript Operators?

Ans2.  JavaScript operators are symbols or keywords that perform operations on operands
 (variables or values). They allow you to manipulate and perform various tasks on data.
 These operators are essential for performing a wide range of tasks in JavaScript, from 
 simple arithmetic calculations to complex logical operations. Understanding how to use 
 operators effectively is fundamental to writing efficient and expressive code in JavaScript.

Q3. Explain the Assignment Operator.

Ans3. The assignment operator in JavaScript is denoted by the equals sign (=). It is used 
to assign a value to a variable. The syntax is as follows:

variable = expression;

variable is the name of the variable, and expression is the value or calculation that you
 want to assign to the variable.

 let x = 10; // Assigning the value 10 to the variable x
 let y = x + 5; // Assigning the result of the expression x + 5 to the variable y

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q4. Explain the all Arithmetic Operators.

Ans4. Perform mathematical calculations on numeric values.

let sum = 10 + 5; // Addition
let difference = 10 - 5; // Subtraction
let product = 10 * 5; // Multiplication
let quotient = 10 / 5; // Division
let remainder = 10 % 3; // Modulus

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q5. What are the Binary Operators in js.

Ans5. Binary operators in JavaScript are operators that take two operands (values or
 variables) and perform an operation between them.

1. Arithmetic Operators
2. Comparison Operators
3. Logical Operators
4. Assignment Operators
5. Bitwise Operators
6. String Concatenation Operator
7. Instanceof Operator

Q6. Explain the Pre-Increment and Post Increment in js.

Ans6. In JavaScript, both pre-increment and post-increment are unary operators that 
increase the value of a variable by 1. 

1. Pre-Increment (++variable): In pre-increment, the increment operation is performed before the value of
 the variable is used in the expression.

 let x = 5;
 let y = ++x;
 
 console.log(x); // Output: 6
 console.log(y); // Output: 6

 2. Post-Increment (variable++): In post-increment, the increment operation is performed after the current
  value of the variable is used in the expression.

  let a = 5;
  let b = a++;
  
  console.log(a); // Output: 6
  console.log(b); // Output: 5
